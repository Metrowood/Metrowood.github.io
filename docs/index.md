# Meenachil Rubber Wood
</center>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<center>
We are a company jointly promoted by the Rubber Board, Rubber Producers Societies and KSIDC.
<br>
<br>
In our company we are using rubber wood derived from Rubber trees which have lived their life time yielding their main produce - Latex. We are converting this wood to the grade of Teak, Mahogany and such other hard wood. We make furniture, partitions, paneling items, floor tiles and so on.
<br>
<br>
By making rubber wood as a true substitute to forest wood, we are contributing to the protection of our invaluable tropical rain forests.â€‹ Being a small scale industry in a remote hilly village, we are providing employment to around one hundred persons, thereby contributing to rural development.
