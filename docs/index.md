# Meenachil Rubber Wood
</center>

<center>
We are a company jointly promoted by the Rubber Board, Rubber Producers Societies and KSIDC.
<br>
<br>
In our company we are using rubber wood derived from Rubber trees which have lived their life time yielding their main produce - Latex. We are converting this wood to the grade of Teak, Mahogany and such other hard wood. We make furniture, partitions, paneling items, floor tiles and so on.

By making rubber wood as a true substitute to forest wood, we are contributing to the protection of our invaluable tropical rain forests.â€‹ Being a small scale industry in a remote hilly village, we are providing employment to around one hundred persons, thereby contributing to rural development.
